### Notes
- Ensure you have the necessary tools installed, such as **gcc** or **clang** for compiling C code and a make tool for running tests.
- Use a text editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Vim for an enhanced coding experience.
- [Here](tools/tutorial.md) is a tutorial about how to set up an environment for Venus and Logisim. **Don't use the old `.jar` file that comes with Lab or Project.**
